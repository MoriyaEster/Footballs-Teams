steps:
1 - look for a  convenient API to use. found the *api-football.com* 
    extensive coverage, rich feature set, and user-friendly documentation.
    The free plan should suffice for development and testing purposes.
    Additionally, the availability of live scores and detailed team information aligns well with the project requirements.
2 - start to implement the basics pages (home-page, favorits, team-details) 
3 - working with the API
4 - infinite scrolling
5 - I tried to use the pagination from the API.
    I read the documentation of the API and realize there is no pagination in the team requests.
6 - I decided to implement the infinite scrolling by myself in the front.
7 - adding a team detailes
8 - adding a favorites page with local-store
